# NyxoSky Social App

Welcome friends! This is the codebase for the NyxoSky Social app.

Get the app itself:

- **Web: None, would like to get routing working with cloudflare but not sure how 🫠**
- **iOS: None**
- **Android: TBD, The Play Store isn't privacy friendly so in the mean time view releases for APK**

## Development Resources

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) application, written in the TypeScript programming language. It builds on the `atproto` TypeScript packages (like [`@atproto/api`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@atproto/api)), which are also open source, but in [a different git repository](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto).

There is a small amount of Go language source code (in `./bskyweb/`), for a web service that returns the React Native Web application.

The [Build Instructions](./docs/build.md) are a good place to get started with the app itself.

The Authenticated Transfer Protocol ("AT Protocol" or "atproto") is a decentralized social media protocol. You don't *need* to understand AT Protocol to work with this application, but it can help. Learn more at:

- [Overview and Guides](https://atproto.com/guides/overview)
- [AtProto's GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/discussions)
- [Protocol Specifications](https://atproto.com/specs/atp)
- [Blogpost on self-authenticating data structures](https://bsky.social/about/blog/3-6-2022-a-self-authenticating-social-protocol)

The Bluesky Social application encompasses a set of schemas and APIs built in the overall AT Protocol framework. The namespace for these "Lexicons" is `app.bsky.*`.
